# flolang

[![Python package](https://github.com/ftobler/flolang/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ftobler/flolang/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

This is a programming language project.

Goal is to be able to compile to C and seamlessly integrate it in existing C / C++ projects. Target platforms are small microcontrollers.

Code should be simple and easy to write in a high level syntax. Useful when speed is not an issue, but time to market and memory footprint is of importance.

## project state

* very much a work in progress
* there is a interpreter
* C backend is in planning
